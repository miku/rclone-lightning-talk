## Things past

> This chapter describes the rsync algorithm, an algorithm for the efficient remote up-
date of data over a high latency, low bandwidth link. -- [Efficient Algorithms for Sorting and
Synchronization](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/pd/Tridgell-thesis.pdf)

A glimpse into how practical software projects originate:

> The rsync algorithm was developed out of my **frustration** with the long time it took
to send changes in a source code tree across a dialup network link. I have spent a
lot of time developing several large software packages during the course of my PhD
and **constantly finding myself waiting** for source files to be transferred through my
modem for archiving, distribution or testing on computers at the other end of the link
or on the other side of the world. **The time taken to transfer the changes gave me
plenty of opportunity to think about better ways of transferring files**.
